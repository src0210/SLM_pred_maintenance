# Predictive Maintenance: Statistical Learning for Aircraft Engines

This repository contains Python code developed as part of my MSc in Applied Artificial Intelligence at Cranfield University, focusing on statistical learning methods for predictive maintenance in the aerospace industry.

## Project Overview

Predictive maintenance leverages Data Analytics and Machine Learning to anticipate equipment failure, enabling preemptive actions to avoid costly downtime. This project specifically targets aircraft engine maintenance, utilizing regression and classification methods to accurately predict engine failure times (Time-To-Failure, TTF).

### Key Objectives
- Implement regression models (Simple Linear Regression and Random Forest) to predict the remaining life cycles of aircraft engines.
- Develop a binary classifier (Random Forest) to determine whether an engine is within its critical phase (final 30 cycles before failure).

### Highlights
- Analysis of sensor data distributions and their impact on model selection and performance.
- Comprehensive model evaluation using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, RÂ² for regression, and Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score for classification.
- Insight into feature importance and practical implications for industry application, focusing on model reliability and safety considerations.

## Structure of the Repository
- **Code:** Includes Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating model implementations and evaluations.
- **Report:** [Predictive Maintenance Report (PDF)](predictive_maintenance_report.pdf) detailing the methodologies, reasoning, and evaluation outcomes in depth.

Please refer to the [Predictive Maintenance Report](predictive_maintenance_report.pdf) for an extensive discussion on model selections, hyperparameter tuning, data normalization techniques, and results interpretation.
